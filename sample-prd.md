# **Sample Project Requirements Document - [Project Name]**

This document tracks the functional and non-functional requirements for the project.

## Functional Requirements

### Feature: User Authentication

* **FR-001**
  * **Description:** User Registration
  * **User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access the application.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    1. User provides a valid email and a strong password (e.g., min 8 characters, with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character).
    2. The system validates the input format.
    3. On success, a new user account is created, and the user is automatically logged in.
    4. On validation failure, clear error messages are shown next to the invalid fields.
    5. If the email is already registered, an appropriate error message is displayed.

* **FR-002**
  * **Description:** User Login
  * **User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    1. User provides their registered email and password.
    2. On successful authentication, the user is redirected to their dashboard.
    3. On authentication failure, a generic "Invalid email or password" error is shown.
    4. After 5 failed attempts, the account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Category: Security

* **NFR-001**
  * **Description:** Access Control
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to ensure I can only see and edit my own data so that my information remains private and secure.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    1. All API endpoints that access user-specific resources must be protected by an authorization check.
    2. The check must verify that the authenticated user's ID matches the owner ID of the requested resource.
    3. An attempt to access another user's resource must result in a `404 Not Found` response to avoid leaking information about resource existence.

### Category: Performance

* **NFR-002**
  * **Description:** API Response Time
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want the application to feel responsive and fast so that I can work efficiently.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    * 95% of all API GET requests must complete in under 200ms.
    * 99% of all API POST/PUT/DELETE requests must complete in under 500ms.
    * Page load time for the main dashboard must be under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.

## Non-Functional Requirement Categories

| NFR Category | 1. What it is | 2. Why it Matters (Business Impact) | 3. How You'd Implement/Measure It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security** | Protecting the system and its data from threats. | **CRITICAL.** Prevents fraud, protects citizen data, ensures trust, meets compliance (PCI DSS for payments). A breach is an existential threat. | *Design:* Use OAuth 2.0/JWTs for API auth, encrypt data at rest & in transit, follow OWASP Top 10, use a secrets manager. *Measure:* Pass security scans (SAST/DAST), regular penetration testing. |
| **Reliability / Availability** | The system's ability to operate correctly and consistently. Uptime. | **CRITICAL.** Government clients lose revenue and public trust if their payment systems are down. Ensures business continuity. | *Design:* Deploy across multiple availability zones (AZs), use health checks, implement retry logic for external calls. *Measure:* Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like 99.95% uptime. |
| **Performance / Scalability** | How fast the system responds and its ability to handle increased load. | Prevents user frustration and abandoned transactions. Ensures the system can handle peak loads (e.g., tax season) without crashing. | *Design:* Use stateless services for horizontal scaling, asynchronous processing (e.g., Kafka) for long-running tasks, database indexing, caching. *Measure:* SLOs like "99% of API calls respond in <250ms". |
| **Maintainability** | How easily the system can be modified, fixed, or enhanced. | Lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO). Allows the business to add new features faster and with less risk. | *Design:* Clean architecture, consistent coding standards, good documentation. *Measure:* High unit test coverage (>80%), low cyclomatic complexity, zero critical SonarQube issues . |
| **Observability** | How well you can understand the system's internal state from the outside. | Drastically reduces Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for production issues. Allows you to find and fix problems before customers notice. | *Design:* Implement structured logging, metrics (e.g., Prometheus), and distributed tracing. *Measure:* Ability to trace a single request through multiple services. |
