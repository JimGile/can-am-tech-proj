# **Sample Project Requirements Document - [Project Name]**

This document tracks the functional and non-functional requirements for the project.

## Functional Requirements

### Feature: User Authentication

* **FR-001**
  * **Description:** User Registration
  * **User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access the application.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    1. User provides a valid email and a strong password (e.g., min 8 characters, with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character).
    2. The system validates the input format.
    3. On success, a new user account is created, and the user is automatically logged in.
    4. On validation failure, clear error messages are shown next to the invalid fields.
    5. If the email is already registered, an appropriate error message is displayed.

* **FR-002**
  * **Description:** User Login
  * **User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    1. User provides their registered email and password.
    2. On successful authentication, the user is redirected to their dashboard.
    3. On authentication failure, a generic "Invalid email or password" error is shown.
    4. After 5 failed attempts, the account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Category: Security

* **NFR-001**
  * **Description:** Access Control
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to ensure I can only see and edit my own data so that my information remains private and secure.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    1. All API endpoints that access user-specific resources must be protected by an authorization check.
    2. The check must verify that the authenticated user's ID matches the owner ID of the requested resource.
    3. An attempt to access another user's resource must result in a `404 Not Found` response to avoid leaking information about resource existence.

### Category: Performance

* **NFR-002**
  * **Description:** API Response Time
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want the application to feel responsive and fast so that I can work efficiently.
  * **Expected Behavior:**
    * 95% of all API GET requests must complete in under 200ms.
    * 99% of all API POST/PUT/DELETE requests must complete in under 500ms.
    * Page load time for the main dashboard must be under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.

## Non-Functional Requirement Categories

| NFR Category | 1. What it is | 2. Why it Matters (Business Impact) | 3. How You'd Implement/Measure It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security** | Protecting the system and its data from threats. | **CRITICAL.** Prevents fraud, protects citizen data, ensures trust, meets compliance (PCI DSS for payments). A breach is an existential threat. | *Design:* Use OAuth 2.0/JWTs for API auth, encrypt data at rest & in transit, follow OWASP Top 10, use a secrets manager. *Measure:* Pass security scans (SAST/DAST), regular penetration testing. |
| **Reliability / Availability** | The system's ability to operate correctly and consistently. Uptime. | **CRITICAL.** Government clients lose revenue and public trust if their payment systems are down. Ensures business continuity. | *Design:* Deploy across multiple availability zones (AZs), use health checks, implement retry logic for external calls, consider data retention requirements. *Measure:* Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like 99.95% uptime. |
| **Performance / Scalability** | How fast the system responds and its ability to handle increased load. | Prevents user frustration and abandoned transactions. Ensures the system can handle peak loads (e.g., tax season) without crashing. | *Design:* Use stateless services for horizontal scaling, asynchronous processing (e.g., Kafka) for long-running tasks, database indexing, caching. *Measure:* SLOs like "99% of API calls respond in <250ms". |
| **Maintainability** | How easily the system can be modified, fixed, or enhanced. | Lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO). Allows the business to add new features faster and with less risk. | *Design:* Clean architecture, consistent coding standards, good documentation. *Measure:* High unit test coverage (>80%), low cyclomatic complexity, zero critical SonarQube issues . |
| **Observability** | How well you can understand the system's internal state from the outside. | Drastically reduces Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for production issues. Allows you to find and fix problems before customers notice. | *Design:* Implement structured logging, metrics (e.g., Prometheus, Splunk, ELK), and distributed tracing. *Measure:* Ability to trace a single request through multiple services (correlation ids, request ids). |

### SQL vs. NoSQL Considerations

| Factor | Relational (SQL) Database | NoSQL Database | Verdict for a Financial Transaction System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Structure & Model** | **Highly structured**, with a predefined schema (tables, columns, data types). Enforces data integrity at the database level. | **Flexible schema** for unstructured or semi-structured data (JSON documents, key-value pairs, etc.). | **Strongly Favors SQL.** Financial transactions are inherently structured and have a rigid, predictable schema (amount, currency, account IDs, timestamp). A strict schema is a feature, not a bug, as it prevents bad data. |
| **Transactions & Consistency** | **ACID compliant** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Guarantees that a transaction is either fully completed or fully rolled back. This is critical for reliability [so-4]. | Often follows the **BASE model** (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency). Prioritizes availability over immediate consistency, which can lead to temporary data discrepancies [so-5]. | **Overwhelmingly Favors SQL.** For a payment system, you absolutely cannot have eventual consistency. A transaction must be atomic. You need to know with 100% certainty that money was moved and recorded, or it wasn't. ACID isn't negotiable here. |
| **Scalability** | Traditionally **scales vertically** (bigger server), but modern SQL databases have excellent horizontal scaling features (read replicas, sharding) [so-1]. | Natively designed to **scale horizontally** (more servers), which is ideal for massive, unpredictable workloads [so-1]. | **SQL is the better fit.** While the system needs to scale, the load for a government payment processor is likely high but predictable (e.g., peaks during tax season). The complexity of managing a distributed NoSQL cluster is likely unnecessary, and a well-architected SQL setup can easily handle the scale required. |
| **Query Complexity** | **Excellent for complex queries**, joins, and aggregations. SQL is a powerful, standardized language for ad-hoc data analysis and reporting [so-6]. | Querying can be less flexible. Complex joins are often difficult or impossible, requiring you to de-normalize data or perform joins in the application layer. | **Strongly Favors SQL.** You will inevitably need to run complex reports for auditing, reconciliation, and business intelligence (e.g., "Show me all failed transactions over $500 for Municipality X in the last quarter"). SQL is purpose-built for this. |

### Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Object Storage Considerations

Core API services are for processing dynamic, transactional data. CDNs and S3 are for handling two other specific types of data: static front-end assets and large, unstructured binary objects.

| Factor | Core API | CDN | S3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case** | **Processing** | **Delivering** | **Storing** |
| **Cost** | **Low** | **Moderate** | **High** |
| **Performance** | **High** | **Medium** | **Low** |
| **Security** | **High** | **Low** | **High** |
| **Scalability** | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
| **Availability** | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
| **Reliability** | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
| **Observability** | **High** | **Medium** | **High** |
